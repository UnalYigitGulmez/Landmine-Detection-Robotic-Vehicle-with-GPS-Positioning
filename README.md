# Landmine-Detection-Robotic-Vehicle-with-GPS-Positioning
A robot that can detect iron mines manually and automatically.

A robot that can detect iron mines manually and automatically.

Written in Arduino.

When operating automatically, it scans 1 square meter in a snake-like pattern.

You can operate it manually with a joystick.

There is an LCD screen on the controller. When our robot encounters an obstacle or metal while operating automatically or manually, it stops and sends a signal and coordinates to the controller. Communication is facilitated by nrf24l01. Coordinates are obtained using the neo-7m GPS module.
